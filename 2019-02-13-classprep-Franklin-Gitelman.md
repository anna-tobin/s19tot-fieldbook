# Class Preparation #8
## The Culture of Printing

These readings made me think about how the "culture" of printing and how it endured was influenced by the history of the printing press and the letterpress, what Gitelman calls the "cult of Gutenberg and Franklin" (188). I think much of the appeal of press printing comes from the vocational movement that popularized its use. It was an industry of tradesmen, and, highlighted by Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, powered by workers who would master their craft and sustain their trade by their own means. Franklin himself can be seen as a figure to look up to; in his printing-house he was able to make his own sorts, engravings, and ink in order to run the press (Franklin 45). Franklin's experience is also a testament to how labor is constantly traded and negotiated in fields like printing. Laborers move where the work is, and in order for printing to become a widespread industry, those skills learned in an apprenticeship needed to be applicable anywhere that worker went.
