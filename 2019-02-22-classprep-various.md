# Class Preparation #10
## Women in Printing

After reading Sarah Werner's piece "Finding Women in the Printing Shop" and the pieces surrounding the Victoria Press, the complications of women creating a space for themselves in printing during its industrialization became apparent. I found it interesting that, noted in Werner's article, women were present in the printing and rights transactions of books during the earlier stages of the printing press. Werner's ability to trace the holders of the different editions really impressed me, and from these records, you're able to see "women in nearly all the roles associated with making books" (Werner). I find this important to contrast with the struggle for women to gain a place in printing once it was industrialized in the 1800's. When printing became a widespread trade and presented a more physical, bodily process, it was believed that "printing by women was an impossibility" (Faithful 38). This argument to bar women from certain professions is widespread across trades and has really only dissapated once the need for the additional labor becomes apparent or individuals take action themselves. 

The documentation of the history of the Victoria Press is really interesting to me. It reminds me a topic we're discussing in my Publishing in the 21st Century course, on how the industry of rare books is a male-dominant space, and room is just now being made to preserve the writings and rare collections of female writers. In the same vein, this history of these female printers is just as worthy of preservation and study as other pieces of printing history.
