# Class Preparation #19
## Future of Football and *The Book*

Experiencing Bois' "What Football Will Look Like in the Future" and reading the last two chapters of *The Book* brought to light the different formats through which the literary texts are being published that challenge or don't conform to the traditional codex. The nature of the presentation of Bois' work was considered more of an *experience* than a reading since the I had to move around the web page and interact with video greatly affected how the text was consumed and interpreted. The creativity surrounding the user experience in these new texts can devlop and evolve with technology and change the traditional form of the "book," but the value of recording, containing, and reading information will always be present.

The analysis of this piece of space brings to light a part of our environment that tends to be on the outskirts of our attention. It highlights the taken-for-granted nature that humans often have for the luxuries and phenonmenon that we experience.
