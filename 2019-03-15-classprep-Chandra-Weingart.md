# Class Preparation #14
## Programming and human agency

The two articles and the bot database assigned as readings made me think about the amount of human decision, agency, and interpretation involved in computer programming that seems to be overlooked intially due to the automated result of a program. Chandra and Weingart both go into the process and challenge of programmers creating code and users interacting with it. It highlighted to me, coming from a very minimal computer science background, how much creative thought and potential bias could make its way into a program. 

A bot that I looked into was @wikisext. The bot formulates sexts drawing its information from random WikiHow pages and populates it into a standard format. The result is a tweet such as "sext: you drink warm liquids while I stay away from social media outlets". I was impressed by the source material that this programmer used. Pulling nouns from a selected article ensures that the words being changed are going to be beyond the realm of sexual content, but still make sense together as a coherent tweet. The editorial statement for this bot on the bot database notes how this bot is able to create metaphors and conjur euphemisns for explicet things that a viewer is left to interpret. So the tweet itself has little meaning to its author (the bot), and all its meaning comes from its audience.
