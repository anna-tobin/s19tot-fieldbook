## Producing Type for the Printing Press

Out of all the knowledge and innovation that Gutenberg needed to invent the printing press, what impressed me the most was the process of creating the pieces of type used for printing. I never considered that there would be multiple steps in carving and casting that would go into creating the final stamp that would print the text. The demonstration in the documentary of creating a punch for the letter "e" showcased how laborious a task like this would have been. Fry said that it took about a day to do one letter, which is only a small piece of what's needed to print such a long text. The labor of creating type is even more apparent after reading Borsuk's chapter on "The Book as Content," where she explains that Gutenberg's matrices would have to be broken in order to release the piece of type and each matrix replaced if that letter needed another piece (67). However, this labor is minute in comparison to the labor involved with handwriting. Despite the labor it took to bring together all the components of printing, it must have been a marvel to have the ability to make multiple identical copies of a single text without the need of a skilled scribe.
