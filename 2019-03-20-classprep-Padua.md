# Class Preparation #15
## Lovelace and Babbage

Padua's graphic novel on Lovelace and Babbage made me consider the challenge of creating characters out of primary historical source material. Padua lists extensively her sources and where she draws the dialogue and situations of the graphic novel from. She's able to create very entertaining depictions of the pair and dramatize their biographical, and the fictional, lives of each. It makes me think of other media that seeks to utilize historical figures as characters in a larger fictional story. There was a trend of Abraham Lincoln zombie media that presented Lincoln as a presidential figure and a zombie hunter. While not as historically justified as Padua's novel, it supports the fascination and appeal of paroding historical figures in fictional tales.
