# Class Preparation #2
## _The Book_, "The Book as Object"

In the first chapter of _The Book_, Borsuk details the history of the book as a mode of containing and carrying information. Specifically, she expands on the evolution of the _means_ of containing this information: the surface used to hold the words, the writing impliments used to create the information, and the means to bind it all together. She prefaces this history by discussing the effect this development has on the content itself:

>Content does not simply necessitate its form, but rather writing develops alongside, influences, and is influenced by the technological supports that facilitate its distribution. (Page 3)
>  												

Through a modern lens, it is easy to assume that any development in writing or in the format of the book has been taken solely to benefit the reader's needs. But as Borsuk points out, the relationship is not simply one-way. In its early history, the book as a medium was more influenced by the technological advancements within its cultural context, and then the mechanics of the writing followed suit. For example, the development of the traditional Chinese style of writing from top to bottom arose directly from the materiality of the bamboo material used to write on (26).

One mode of written communication that Borsuk discusses that diverges from the model seen in today's codex is the South American _khipu_. This way of writing, visually similar to a kind of weaving, seems much more abstract than the other forms Borsuk discusses, however serving a similar purpose. The unanswered questions surrounding this medium are intriguing and may remain that way due to the erasure of its practice by the Spanish colonists.
