# Class Preparation #9
## Fonts

The readings for today's class focused on fonts, an element of modern text that was invented alongside the use of the printing press. While handwriting could have different styles, the sorts used in a printing press opened up a whole new realm of design as the styles could be replicated on a mass scale. The readings specifically bring up an important point of how font and the composition of a text can affect the perception of the reader. I found the Higgs Boson situation in "How typeface influences the way we read and think" surprising in the organization's choice of presentation and found the reaction of the public very relatable. If something is in a font that's unfitting of its genre, like comic sans in a scholarly text, I am also pretty quick to dismiss it as legitimate. 

I was able to experience, in action, Lynch's point in "How I Came to Love the En Space" about the negative space of a page becoming something tangible to be considered in composing. Needing to think about and compensate for the spaces needed in order to justify the text and space out lines by physically placing something was a new way of thinking for me. When using a program of InDesign to layout a document, your empty space on a page is just empty space, allowing you to consider your text as the only "content" to move around and shape, thus affecting the negative space. But, when Annie and I were composing our text, we had to consider how the spaces between our lines would physically work within our composition.
