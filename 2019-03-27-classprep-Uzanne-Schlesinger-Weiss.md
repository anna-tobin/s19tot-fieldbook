# Class Preparation #17
## Text in transistion 

The article "The End of Books" and the documentary "Farewell - ETAOIN SHRDLU" both brought up the anxieties and possibilities that come with technological transistion and advancement. The documentary in particular highlighted the experience of those working hands-on in printing during the transistion from hot metal type to digital type and paper composing. I found this to be a really interesting perspective during such a pinacle moment in publishing history, and the fact that we it preserved and documented on film is fantastic. The sentiments of the printers in particular seemed to be hestitant towards the change, but ultimately it seemed that most of the employed printers for the New York Times were able to transistion to working on the computers. I found the increased productivity of the computer composistion in comparison to the metal type to be incredible. It must have drastically changed the way the news was produced and treated once it didn't take so long to produce each line of type.
