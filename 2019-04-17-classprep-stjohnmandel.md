# Class Preparation #22
## *Station Eleven*

One of the things that finishing *Station Eleven* made me consider is how it's hard to conceptulize periods of time in history where little to no technological progress was made. In particular, it made me think of how we consider the Dark Ages, or the period during adn after The Black Plague where much of the European population was wiped out. *Station Eleven* presents a scenerio which places our modern-day selves into that kind of period of regression and stagnation, which to our technology-driven lives is a huge fear and shock. The scope of the regression is made clear when Clark realizes he's witnessed the end of electricity (251). The steps and ingenuity that has to be done to return to that point can take countless years and the work and labor of countless people. I think this moment brings to light the struggle of adapting to your current situation while also trying to organize the means to invent and create new technologies that better our way of life.
