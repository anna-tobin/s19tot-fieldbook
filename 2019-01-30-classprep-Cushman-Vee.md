# Class Preparation #5
## Sequoyah's Exposure to the English Language

In the reading about Sequoyah, I found the explanation to his exposure to English telling of how different forms of communication permeate through groups by serving a specific purpose. Sequoyah, being a skilled silversmith, needed to brand his work in order for it to be traced back to him, so he copied the shape of his name onto his work. This need to communicate ownership reminded me of how the earliest forms of writing were developed in order to communication transactions and ownership of property. Sequoyah's experience with the English language and the frustration of not being literate in that language seemed to have motivated him to develop his own language, for his own people. The privilege of being literate was something he wanted to fabricate for the Cherokee in a way they couldn't experience before being solely exposed to written English. 

Tangentially, sometimes I grow concerned that I will never be literate in the language of code and will always be an outsider to the developments and opportunities offered to those that are. I fear that my future success will be compromised or that one day, God forbid, I become one of those adults that constantly ask for help from the tech-savvy child in their family.
