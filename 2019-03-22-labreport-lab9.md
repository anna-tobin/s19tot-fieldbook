# Lab Report #9
## Computational Reading I


Transforming literary text into data provided a new way of looking at text that I'm sure writers like Marian Evans and Jane Austen never even considered. Breaking down text by counting words or phrases and categorizing them seperate from their literary context can provide useful information in analyzing bodies of work by certain authors or within certain genres, but this information still needs to be cared for by a researcher who can bring in that literary context to the data they are able to pull. Through the ways we were able to analyze the content of the works of Jane Austen, I believe one of the major uses of this kind of computational reading is word choice analysis. Trends in distinct word or phrase choice can be determined and analyzed to provide support to different arguments regarding literature. This has the potential to highlight the cultural context and linguistic movements in which the text was created. While being able to farm this kind of data from a collection of texts is useful, there still needs to be recognition of the text as a whole, and the meanings that can be made in reading the text.
