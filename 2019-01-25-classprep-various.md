#Class Preparation #4
##Illuminated Manuscripts and the Role of a Scribe 

The responsibility of a scribe to replicate knowledge comes under harsh judgement by some. Knowing that the copying of texts was in the hands of other human beings, prone to natural error, seemed to caused anxieties in those who felt strongly about the original work. The tone of Ælfric in regards to scribes highlights the risk of human error in the writing tradition.
 
> I ask now in the name of God, if anyone desires to copy this book, that he corrects it well by the exemplar, because I have no control if someone brings it to error through lesser scribes, and it is then his peril, not mine. The bad scribe does much evil if he will not correct his errors.  
> 
> -- _Ælfric's "Preface to Genesis," translated by Brandon W. Hawk_

Ælfric reluctantly, with his Lord's blessing, relinquishes control to the scribes who may or may not do their job correctly. This kind of relationship, between "keeper" of the work and the ones tasks with duplicating it, is just beginning to develop and leads to doubts. The praise for scribes doesn't do much to relieve the pressure of their task, for they have become the communicators and distributors of the Church, and without them "faith would weaken, charity would freeze, hope would die, law would perish, Scripture fall into oblivion" (Trithemius). 

In Chaucer's words to his scrivener, he predicts that he'll have to correct his mistakes when his text is to be copied. This expectation for scribes, in addition to the video detailing the creation of an illuminated manuscript, made me realized that the labor the monks had to do was compounded upon every time they made a mistake. In comparison to today, when making mistakes in writing is permissible and often reversible, the hand-copying of writing seemed much more high-stakes and less forgiving. Although the writers could scrape away at the ink to remove errors, it must have been incredibly frustrating to have to stop the flow of work to reshape a letter or correct an ink blot. And the training to get to that point of filling these bound manuscripts must have been just as tasking. I wonder if the how rigorous the training for monk scribes, perhaps new to the tools of writing themselves, was, if they had any at all.
