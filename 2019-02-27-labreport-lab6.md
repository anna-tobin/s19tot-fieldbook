# Lab Report #6
## Letterpress III: Pulling the Press

Through the experience of the letterpress lab, I have come to a better understanding of the amount of expertise, patience, labor, and ingenuity it must have taken to successfully establish and run a printing business and create printed books. Making our own compositions and learning the trade over the course of the three weeks made me think of the seven-year apprenticeship process for prospective compositors, detailed in Benjamin Franklin's and Emily Faithfull's writings. Over the course of that training, the intricacies of the job like the location of sorts and the orientation they need to be arranged must have become second-nature. For me, it put printmaking and bookmaking in the position of other trades, like welding and electrical work, that require training so that the knowledge and skills of the job becomes integral to the worker doing it. Experiencing the letterpress has also given me a new perspective on a book's material value. The amount of time that has gone into printing a book, from the writer's labor, the training of the workers, and the production of the printing materials like the paper and ink, make the completed codex seem extraordinary. The cultural phenomenon of the printed book seems even more justified.
