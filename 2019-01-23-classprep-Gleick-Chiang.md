## "The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling" and _The Information_, Prologue to Chapter 2

As transmitting and receiving information has become more and more accessible through technology, questions have been raised about how this information can be defined, how the communicators understand it, and what sorts of implications does it have on human behavior. 

The first few chapters of Gleick's book seem to address the first two questions, dealing more with the logistics and linguistic approaches of the development of different languages. As telecommunication was developing, the information that was being sent from source to receiver had to be defined and measured. The term "information" had to be honed down from its previous "soft and inclusive" definition (7). Gleick details the study of the unique transmittal of information of the African drum language. The way that this language communicates information is unique from English, as there is no alphabet and the majority of meaning of words comes from inflection and contextual information. Gleick's compares the extra contextual information needed with drumming to the language of aviation radio (26), which made me wonder what other forms of communication rely on that extra context to achieve clarity, and the kinds of situations that need that sort of definitive clarity.   

Chiang's short story, on the other hand, deals with the implications of new media on human behavior, through the point of view of an aged journalist tasked with reviewing a new memory retrieval device that makes him realize his faults as a father. The journalist's experience is juxtaposed with the story of a young boy from a colonized village learning writing from a visiting European, his culture having no form of written language beforehand. Both of these stories present the ability to record and retrieve information as something that can be both a hinderance and a benefactor to interpersonal communication. I think Chiang's choice to weave these two narratives together shows how this anxiety that comes with new technology, that it was destroy human interaction and development, has existed throughout the progression of technology-enhanced communication.
