# Class Preparation #11
## Novels as Glutton

From reading the collection of texts from the 1800's warning about the dangers of the novel, the comparison between the act of reading and the act of eating was very forward, which I found fascinating. In these texts, reading is regarded as an act that's sacred, and not understanding moderation and the value of the content you're consuming can lead to corruption and, in the more extreme cases, death. "On Novel Reading" directly makes the comparison between novel reading and gluttonous eating, arguing "the early use of savoury dishes is not usually followed by an appetite for plain food. To the taste, thus pampered, history becomes dry, grammar laborious, and religion dull" (47). This idea, that too many novels in a reader's "book diet" will lead to a disinterest in the "dry" areas of literature, contrasts so greatly to our own beliefs today that pretty much any reading from the book is legitimate and an act worthy of praise, especially for an early reader. This fear of apathy extends to the enjoyment of reality as well. In the same text, reality will become "vulgar" (48) to the reader that indulges too much in novels. Both the excerpts from "Devouring Books" and "Novel Writers and Publishers" contain this worry as well, highlighting how reading novels leads to fantastical behavior and can harm the body like an abused drug. The tone of these texts evokes a feeling of an older generation trying to explain the behaviors of youth and the popularity of a new phenomenon. Before novels became popular, I imagine the only understanding of how to read a book was the engaged, pen-in-hand method that we discussed in "How to Read Like a Renaissance Reader." Novels presented stories that didn't need to be properly "digested" and created a pace in reading that must have been shocking to see.
