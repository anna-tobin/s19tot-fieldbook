# Class Preparation #16
## Lovelace and Babbage 2

In this section of Padua's graphic novel, she explores Lovelace's character in an incredibly meta way. Imposing Lovelace's character into the story of Alice in Wonderland provides an interesting way to look at the conflict and general nonsensicalness of mathamatics and poetry. The fact that Lovelace's story was cut short with her early death leads to this opprotunity to ponder her character in this creative way.
