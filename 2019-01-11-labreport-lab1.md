# Lab Report #1
## Understanding Textual Structure with Markdown

After being introduced to Markdown in class and completing a handful of entries using it, it seems bare in comparison to the word processors I'm more familiar with, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Markdown seems to eliminate any tools or advanced stylistic choices that would get in the way of the writer. The text itself is the priority, and any choices in the organization or style of this information can be integrated seamlessly within the action of typing. It ensures that information is composed quickly and clearly, and the integration of code provides an outlet for expansion on the text (if that language is known by the writer.) Overall, I find it a lot more appealing if I want to quickly get my thoughts down and develop a "flow" to my writing practice. Often times, when faced with the blank, new page of a word document, it feels overwhelming to start and the need to fill the page becomes the only thing I can think about. Markdown eliminates this concern with its format completely. 

As a mode of communication, Markdown seems to be behind a wall of "new media" that the general public hasn't broken through yet. Before using it in this class, I had only heard of it from one of my friends who uses it for work in developing code with a team of programmers. So my understanding of what it looked like or what it meant to work on Github were pretty abstract. My thoughts on the materiality of this medium are still forming. I think about how the files I'm creating look, where they are going, who can see them, and what kind of persistance they will have through time, if any. These thoughts seem quite simple, and I think a computer science major could probably explain point-blank what the answers are, but overall the actual way the text is being formed in this format is a lot less tangible and hard to consider. "The mysteries surrounding the virtual inscription of digital documents" (Gitelman 19) is, I suppose, the part of what will be fleshed out as we interact with this "new media." 

I think that anyone without a moderate understanding of digital computing would find Markdown much more of a reach to understand than other formats, like Microsoft Word. Markdown strips all the aspects that may help the user transition from the material practice of writing to digital. I believes this signifies a move into a use of media that can further extend our abilities digitally, now that we have been accustomed to computing for multiple generations.
