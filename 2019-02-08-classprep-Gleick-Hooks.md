# Class Preparation #7
## Creating the Rules of Writing, Reading, and Type

The readings and videos assigned for today made me think about how, along with the invention of writing, reading, and printing, standardized sets of rules and procedures had to be established in order for the success of the book to endure. From Gleick's chapter "Two Wordbooks," it's understood that, before the establishment of the alphabet or dictionaries, words did not have a definite, universal spelling. He highlights the individuality of the spelling of words by stating that "every time people dipped quill in ink to form a word on paper they made a fresh choice of whatever letters seemed to suit the task" (Gleick 53). The urge and movement towards a standardized set of letters and words seemed to become necessary once books were able to be produced and distributed beyond the writer and their immediate location. 


I saw parallels between this process of rulemaking and the vocational videos made for those entering the printing trade. The printing industry that developed by the 1940's is a clear expansion of Gutenberg's original invention. There are many jobs, machines, and processes to familiarize yourself with and a need to master the specific area you choose to apprentice for. In order to make printing such a large industry, the same kinds of standardizations and rules had to be established so that workers could be easily trained and machines could be widely made for the jobs they had to perform.
