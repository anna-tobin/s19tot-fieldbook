# Class Preparation #1
## "Architectures of the Page"

In her retelling of the history of the page, Mak brings to light the important and functional choices that were made to the style of the page as literacy and publishing evolved. She looks at the page as a unit of structure and holds it at an equal, if not greater, level of importance as the content it carries. Looking at the page as a medium, its development and design evolved as readers' needs evolved. Choices in design that we still see today were made with the text's functionality and intention in mind. Blank spaces were skillfully placed in order to "provide openings for readers to pause and consider the thoughts that they have encountered" (17). From a publishing and design perspective, it was really interesting to see how certain elements of the modern novel started, like the terms *recto* and *verso* and the way chapters and paragraphs are broken up.
