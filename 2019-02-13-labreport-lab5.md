# Lab Report #5
## Letterpress II: Creating the Job

When setting up our jobs for the printer, one of the major choices we had to make was what font to use. It was a solid commitment once we chose and got started on our composition, since there was no way to change the font on the fly like on a computer. It made me wonder about the thought that went into designing typefaces when they were expected to be repurposed again and again. How did these early typeface designers intend for fonts to be read? In relation to Gayomali's discussion on how type is perceived by readers, did the connotations that certain fonts have come about through their use? After looking more deeply into a particular font (GT Cinetype) I found that the rationale behind the design of fonts is deep and meaningful, and some of that awareness I feel is lost when fonts have become such a commodity in the digital age. 

The stylistic decisions of early compositors that Lynch mentions in her article became apparent to me firsthand through this lab. She explains the many different fonts used in a single publication was often a solution to a material problem, that "if, for instance, a typesetter is compiling a line of text in 24-point Franklin Gothic and needs eight uppercase ‘A’s but only has five—perhaps one word can be set in an altogether different typeface." We had to do exactly that, composing our poem in two different fonts after running out of e sorts in our original case. It was a problem I had never encountered before and having to figure out on-the-fly how best to solve the issue while maintaining readability and consistency was difficult. I'm fascinated that early typesetters were able to come up with a solution that was still quite aesthetically pleasing.
