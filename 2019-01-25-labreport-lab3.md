# Lab Report #3
## Illuminating the Book

Working by candlelight for this lab taught me, in short, I would probably not make a good scribe. The work was tedious, and because of the hand-written letter by Virgina Woolf I had to copy, a bit panic-inducing. I was doubting if I even knew how to read properly since I found the handwriting so hard to decipher. I would contemplate going back and trying to figure out the exact words I was copying, but in the end, I prioritized moving forward with the work, despite the illegibility of my copy. It made it clearer the level of expertise these scribes had to have in their work. Mastering reading and writing in a particular style seems crucial and would probably be the result of a long training process for novice scribes. 

The physical strain involved in the handwritten tradition was also became apparent. My shoulders tensed, my hand cramped, and my eyes became sore. It reminded me of the physical ailments of writing a long paper through the night: the eye strain from the screen, the carpel tunnel, and the back pain of being hunched over a desk. However, the strain endured writing by candlelight felt less justifiable since it was such a slow level of progress. I also felt myself becoming easily distracted, my eyes wondering to the writing my peers were completing, or to simply stare at the flame and take a break from the task at hand. 

Another "media adjacent" technology I was considering is the effect that the use of the curtain had on the development of contemporary theater. The curtain is separate from the process of writing the content of a play. The writer may consider it in their stage directions, but it is not the main focal point of the creative process. However, the development of the curtain in the traditional version of a theater has affected the medium of theater, changing the way plays are performed and how an audience consumes the performance itself. The curtain gives the power to hide elements of the production that the audience shouldn't see and widened the possibilities of the stage.
