# Class Preparation #20
## *Station Eleven*, up to page 115

After reading this first part of *Station Eleven*, what I found interesting about the world after the Georgia Flu hits is how media that we consider to be ever-present becomes more ephemeral. The music and plays that the Symphony performs become something that can only be experienced and referenced through their performance. Recordings can no longer be accessed, so the players have more control of what can be considered the "true" performance or interpretation of a piece.
