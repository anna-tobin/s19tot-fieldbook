#Lab Report #2
##Into the Archive/Thinking with the Codex
###1-16-2019

One of the texts I chose to observe was Buteo Delphinaticus' _Bvteonis Delphinatici Opera Geometrica_ (1554), a geometry textbook written in Latin. The specific spread of this text I observed (pages 110-111) has a full-page illustration on the verso side and text with an embedded geometric diagram on the recto. An embellished capital "A" accompanies the text, depicting a cherub hiding behind the letter. The other spread I was able to observe in person was from Benjamin Franklin's _Briefe von der Elektricit채_ (1758), a German publishing of Franklin's discoveries on electricity. This spread (pages 70-71) features gothic type in an atypical layout with a detailed image on the recto page. (It looks like the text is formatted as a letter, but my very limited understanding of German restricts my ability to confirm.) From the digital sources, I looked at Andreas Vesalius' _De Humani Corporis Fabrica_ (1543), a book detailing human anatomy. This spread detailed two full page illustrations of the human skeletal and muscle systems with texts identifying the different anatomical parts.   

_Geometrica_, published as an academic text during the 16th century, would have been used by the elite in their studies. The size of the book, about 9 by 11 inches, reflects its higher value, since more precious materials and labor had to be put into printing and binding it. _Elektricit채_, on the other hand, is smaller, about the size of a modern-day mass-market paperback. Based on its size, it seems much more likely this was published with the intention of a wide-spread readership. The paper used for this book, in comparison to the former, contains dark speckles and some impurities. This may be a result of the aging of the book, but it could also suggest that the materials used to make the paper could not be refined enough to give it a purer surface. _Corportis Fabrica_ has a page height of about 42 cm and around 700 pages. This large volume would have been difficult to transport, so it most likely stayed in the library where it was kept. The detail and rich colors of the illustrations also suggest this book was of high value. Like _Geometrica_, copies of this book were most likely owned by scholars or royalty. 

All of these publications were printed, but the style of their type differs drastically. _Geometrica_ has the uniformaty and rigidness of Roman type arranged into long, wide paragraphs that adjust to the images on the page. _Elektricit채_ features gothic type, replicating the aesthetic of handwriting, in tight, narrow paragraphs. Both of these choices in style seek to accomplish a goal for the text. While the Roman type seems akin to the work of the philosophers and scholars of the Classical Era, the gothic type replicates the kind of authority the handwriting of scribes had before the invention of printing. _Corportis Fabrica_ contains a type thats a combination of the two. The type has subtle extensions of its lines that allude to handwritten script without the heavy calligraphy of _Elektricit채_'s gothic type.

While all these text seek to educate on the mathematical or scientific, they each are designed and printed in varying ways that denote the importance of the information they contain and who gets to access it.
