# Class Preparation #12
## Crediting authors and creators

The situation surrounding the poem "The Children" discussed in "'Fugitive Verses': The Circulation of Poems in Nineteenth-Century American Newspapers" reminds me of how crediting content online is often treated. Images and texts that "go viral" are often replicated, to an even greater extent than Dickinson's poem, by multiple platforms and sources. It is almost commonly accepted that it's okay to share meme images without any attribution, which is often detrimental to memes that were sourced from the work of artists and content creators that depend on their work for their livlihood. Just recently, the instagram marketing account FuckJerry was called out by a handful of comedians for stealing and repurposing their content. This account would screenshot tweets, reupload video, and repurpose other created content with any credit to the original author cropped out in order to promote various movies, apps, television series, and other products. This kind of fugitive republication gets complicated in the digital age. Sources are aware of the replication of their content a lot faster than when there was only print media, and the implications become a lot grander. Like how the mistake between Dickinson and Dickens was made "by some careless compositor" (36), the redaction of credit from any kind of social media content can be as simple as accidently cropping out a source or reuploading content without any credit.
